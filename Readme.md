# Turbo Gravity Lemming Raketti Force

Three of the best games combined into one!

The issues I'm looking into are:
- Add network play (seems doable; requires above to be fixed)
- Clean stuff up!

For someone else (Stef?):
- Fix the level parsing and building correct collision geometry
- Fix audio (content cooking and playback)
- Integrate content builder to solution (see MonoGame NuGet docs)
- Clean stuff up!

Oh and make it fun \^_^
