=Turbo Gravity Lemming Raketti Force

Three of the best games combined into one!

The issues I'm looking into are:
   - Fix the rendering (I don't mind it being sprites for now).
   - Camera is acting weird (same for both players?)
   - Add network play (seems doable; requires above to be fixed)
   - Clean stuff up!

For someone else (Stef?):
   - Fix the level parsing and building correct collision geometry
   - Fix audio (content cooking and playback)
   - Integrate content builder to solution (see MonoGame NuGet docs)
   - Add firing bullets
   - Clean stuff up!

Oh and make it fun ^_^
